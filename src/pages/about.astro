		<p>
			I'm an electrical engineer specialized in electronics and telecommunications, and a passionate
			about technology. My interests span across self-driving cars, space technology, embedded
			systems, digital and graph signal processing, deep learning, data science, and quantitative
			finance.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my free time, I dive into software and hardware projects, tackle intriguing mathematical
			problems, and stay active with sports like swimming, running, and biking. I also enjoy
			strategy games, from chess to the traditional German card game, Skat.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now, I'm developing a Skat-playing engine inspired by Stockfish for chess, learning Rust
			for future embedded systems projects, and teaching Skat to 20 students at the University of
			SÃ£o Paulo to keep the game alive in Brazil.
