Back in that day, I was not in engineering school yet, and this experience made everything change. 

I was a mathematics student who got my first internship in a bank. Also worth pointing out, is that I was not originally from São Paulo, and this experience exposed me a bit to the "Paulista" lifestyle.

I remember I was stunningly happy when I found out about the acceptance to the internship. Until when I found out that the work was super boring. But there was some interesting learning there: 

1. How the credit system works
    - What to take
    - What to not take
2. Microsoft Office is a must for cooperative environments
    - Excel and PPT
3. Cooperative work can be disturbing
    - Overnight huge changes
    - Impressing the bosses is necessary to grow

Fortunately, my boss was quite different from that environment. He was open-minded and adept at innovation. He thought ahead of the others and gave me a project to create a web platform to manage all the credit policies of the team, which back then was chaotic. 

With so much bureaucracy behind this large institution, I somehow was able to develop something with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a backend in Microsoft Sharepoint, crazy days. It was cool and challenging to take so much responsibility and not have to work with the boring things the others had to do. I learned a lot about web development and I'm proud I took this challenge.

I left this place because I decided to take on a new challenge in my life. First, I had some dreams to accomplish, I wanted to study and live abroad, and I had the feeling that studying mathematics would lead to where I already was and not much perspective of growth. I mean, I saw so many mathematicians doing boring work by my side, that I felt that this was it, that's what mathematics can offer me in Brazil. This summed up with the 1h30 to move around in São Paulo with the transport system.

In January 2019, I entered the engineering school at USP.
