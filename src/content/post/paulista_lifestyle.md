I arrived in São Paulo (SP) in 2016 and got a flat in the "Bela Vista" (which translates to Nice View) neighborhood. The view is not that nice. It was pretty expensive I must say, but worth it. It was close enough to Paulista Avenue, so the place and region were pleasant. It is one of the best places one can live in SP. 

One day after my arrival I decided to walk to Paulista Avenue. It was probably a 2km walk. First impressions: dirty city, high amount of people smoking. After some years I got used. But here are the reasons for the shock. Cities in the countryside are not made for walking. It was pretty rare to walk in Franca, my hometown. You simply go everywhere with a car, even to the bakery that is 1km away. But having a car in SP is simply a nightmare, it's paying to live worse.

## Good part

## Bad part 1 - Loneliness

## Bad part 2 - Time-space

In 2018, I got an internship at Itaú (check the blog post about it) and was stunningly happy. First, because Itaú is one of the largest companies in Brazil. Second, I needed to earn some money, the costs of living in São Paulo were high and Brazil was just recovering from a recession that started after the Presidential Impeachment in 2016. Despite not being much enough to cover all costs in São Paulo, it was likely more than what 90% of the Brazilian population earned, and it ended up helping a lot in my monthly expenses (aka, rent and food).

Just when I started working I truly became exposed to what I call as **the "Paulista" lifestyle**.

Every day the average citizen of the city of São Paulo commutes using Bus or Train. You might argue that this is the case everywhere, and probably is in high-density cities. The problem is the amount of time you spend on this activity, which is high in third world countries, likely due to the lack of quality service. Later I heard from a colleague that the problem was even worse in Nigeria. Makes sense, given the population of 17 million in Lagos versus 12 million in SP.

I spent 2h30 hours a day inside a bus or train some days about 4 hours when I needed to go to university. I started asking myself if this was how my life would be for the rest of my days. The average "Paulista" doesn't ask that question, they are so used to it, that it doesn't bother. Sadly working from home was just allowed one day per week for full-time employees, not for interns.

If there are any "Paulista" reading my text, one might argue: why didn't you move out? I did. After COVID, I needed to finish my studies back in my present classes. The closest place I found on my budget was only 20 minutes with a bus to one of the gates of the university, on a good day. If it was raining, or in a high traffic hour, could go up to one hour. Now guess how much more time it took from the gate to the engineering department. I was less stressed living in the Nice View neighborhood. 

## Schluss (Conclusion, sorry I'm learning german)
The "paulista" lifestyle is not for everyone. I would recommend it only if you can afford a nice place, and a car and can work from home, elsewhere you are buying your stress, and the high salaries of SP won't compensate for the lifetime you are wasting.
