I arrived in São Paulo in 2016.

I was stunningly happy. First because Itaú is one of the largest companies in Brazil. Second, I needed to earn some money, the costs of living in São Paulo were high and Brazil was just recoverying from a recession started after the Presidential Impeachment in 2016. 

Despite not being much to cover all costs in São Paulo, it was likely more than what 90% of the Brazilian population earned, and it ended up helping a lot in my monthly expenses (aka, rent and food).

I was born in the country side of the state of São Paulo, and this work experience exposed me to **the "Paulista" lifestyle**. 

Everyday the average citizen of the city São Paulo comutes using Bus or Train. You might argue that this is the case everywhere. However, put in consideration that the population of São Paulo is almost 12 million[^1] people (estimated 2025), the transport system lacks quality, there is a lot of traffic while using Bus, home-office was just starting in 2018.

Concluding, I was spendind an average of 4h a day with transport, because I needed to attend the university after the work, and after sometime This is the "Paulista" lifestyle
