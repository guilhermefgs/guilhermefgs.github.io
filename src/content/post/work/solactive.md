This was one of my first experiences working directly with finance data. In the 10 months I've been with the Complex Product Development team I've deployed and refactored financial indices using Python frameworks. The advantage of the indices framework is the gain in scalability, backtesting generation, deployment, and maintainability.

I had a great experience with the team, where I could learn about many finance topics and the financial industry, apply my software engineering skills to quickly deploy projects, solve issues in the private library, and help colleagues with technical issues.
