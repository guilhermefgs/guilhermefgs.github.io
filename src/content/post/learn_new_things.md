This post aims to be updated from time to time. As I implement strategies in my routine I want to increment what works and what not until it is called: "How I learn new things". [^1] 

[^1]: After so many years I probably should have an algorithm such as the one that I will describe here. In any case, many thanks for the references.

Have you ever hated something that later in life you started liking? Tuna fish cans, avocados, and studying are some topics of my list. Fun fact, is that they ended up being some of the greatest decisions in my life.

I hated studying until I was 17, until I saw my friends entering university and myself staying behind. Not many things later created much internal anger as this event. With 18 years old, I was studying daily 12h~14h. Yes, I wish I could have adviced that young man better. In fact not many people close to me knew much about how to properly study. Bruteforce worked, however, that's exactly what we are trying to avoid with this text.

## Learning Definition

Mr. Feynman defined as the capability to explain it to a child. Let's keep this informal definition for now.


## Theory Overload

If we take complex book and try to read it all in one day, how much would we learn from it? What if we break the reading in a week? In easy words, our brain has an absortion limit, that needs to be properly managed to learn something effectively.

I love the example from [1]. If we try to learn how to shoot an arrow, we can simply repeat, repeat and repeat, making some progress but at one point you need to try different things. In such example, but to most of the ones we will find in life, they are composed of several cognitive resources that are necessary to learn. Something of a problem with small problems inside. Unfortunately, we humans cannot divide an conquer.

For shooting an arrow, this can be control breathing, hold the arrow, aim lower, etc. Each of them, if wanted to learn at the same time will cause theory overload.

## Learning Optimally -- New Theory VS Habit Generation

## 7 Steps to Learn Anything

This is based on [3], that is similar to the 9 steps indicated in [4].

1. Learn how to learn the thing you want to learn;
2. Focus
    - Find a place with no distraction to do the work
3. Do the thing that you want to be good at
    - Example of [3]: he wanted to become good at solving math problems, so he solved lots of math problems
4. Work on your weak points
5. Test yourself
    - Most effective way of learning according to [3]
6. Find someone to get feedback on your work
7. Don't take the answer for the answer
    - You need to find why 

In my opinion this list can be even shorter.
