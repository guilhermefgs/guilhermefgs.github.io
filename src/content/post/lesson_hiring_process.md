## Background with Hiring

# Ita√∫

Here is the thing, for someone who knows nothing about the banks or credit risk such presentations are useless. They talked a lot and I couldn't understand much. 
Here is what I should have asked for all of them:

* How does one day look like at your work? 
* How would you picture the day of an intern at your team?
* Can you explain your area to someone who understands nothing about your area? (perhaps leave this question to the end)

I asked something much more ridiculous but was ok, and by the end of the appointment, I went to talk to Marcelo to ask some other ridiculous[^1] further questions to get me noticed.

[^1]: Don't get me wrong, I say ridiculous because I was asking without understanding, and I should have been more vulnerable and said: I'm not getting it!

Well, it worked.
